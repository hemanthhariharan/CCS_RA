## Documentation

The file CCS_RA_AoR_trials.ipynb uses CCSNetâ€™s API for the 2D isotropic model to run ~500k trials in various batches for both homogeneous and synthetic heterogeneous reservoirs.

The files Output_1.csv, Output_2.csv, ... Output_18.csv correspond to homogeneous reservoirs while Output_19.csv and Output_20.csv correspond to heterogeneous reservoirs.

The file CCS_RA_AoR_data_analysis.ipynb is used to build the parametric tool, nomogram and phase diagram after compiling the data table.

The file CCS_project_tracker_Github.xlsx is the Excel tracker file used to plot real-world CCS projects on the phase diagram.

The link to the paper will be added soon.
